## Questions Judges Might Ask

### Q: "How do you determine if a place is safe?"
**A:** "We use a three-layer approach:
1. Curated database of verified safe areas from trusted sources
2. Heuristic rules (malls, museums, temples are generally safe)
3. Community reviews and ratings (future enhancement)"

### Q: "What about real-time safety updates?"
**A:** "Great question! Phase 2 includes real-time safety alerts, crowd density monitoring, and live location sharing. For this hackathon, we focused on the core filtering and curated data."

### Q: "How accurate is the wheelchair accessibility data?"
**A:** "We've curated data for major venues in 5 cities. We're also planning partnerships with accessibility certification organizations to expand and verify this data."

### Q: "Can users contribute safety information?"
**A:** "Absolutely! Phase 2 includes community safety ratings where women travelers can share their experiences and rate areas. This creates a virtuous cycle of safety information."

### Q: "How does this integrate with the AI trip generation?"
**A:** "When filters are active, the AI receives specific safety instructions. For example, 'CRITICAL: Only recommend well-lit, populated areas safe for solo women travelers.' The AI then generates an itinerary that respects these constraints."
